3.a Report the runtime, throughput of the four schedules in tutorial06
(in the submission form). Which is best? Can you say why it was the
best?

1) ROOT: 11.1ms
2) INLINE: 1.9ms
3) TILING: 2ms
4) TILING + PARALLEL: 1.2ms

Tiling + parallelization gave the best results because it exploits
locality in the images, especially if there is a need to grab neigh-
boring pixels for computations. This helps with the cache, presumably.
Parallelization lets us do multiple of these exploited tiles at once,
which makes sense for even more speedup.
